## Call for Problem Statements and Participation

### Problem Statement Submission

**We are soliciting problem statements (“use cases”) from members of the Homeland Security**
- **Problem statements (“use cases”) should address pressing operational challenges** where generative AI could provide transformative solutions but is currently hindered by concerns about misuse, bias, security, or ethical implications. We seek problems that demand immediate attention and practical solutions. Key areas of interest include, but are not limited to, countering disinformation campaigns, generating synthetic training data while preserving privacy, enhancing threat detection through multimodal analysis, automating the summarization and translation of intelligence reports, improving situational awareness via real-time data synthesis, and ensuring secure and responsible deployment of AI in sensitive operational environments.

The program committee will review these problem statements for overall quality, relevance, likelihood of stimulating constructive discussion, and ability to contribute to an informative
workshop report. Unique positions that are well presented and emphasize potentially-transformative research directions will be given preference.

Selected contributors will have the opportunity to participate in the workshop currently planned as an in-person event June 21st, 2025, or to submit pre-recorded video presentations.

**Paper Length and Format:** Up to 2 pages (references included), at least 11-point font PDF file. Note: papers will be distributed in print at the workshop and published on the workshop website; PDFs may include links to other resources on the Internet.

**Workshop products** will include a publicly available written report that includes the problem statements, white papers, and a summary of the workshop discussions and a video archive of select presentations.
